## Overview
Note: This transliterator is INCOMPLETE. The romanized characters for some Telugu script characters are not fully filled out and have been grouped as such in the telugu_transliterator file.
- The transliterator works by taking in a file, either by stdin or the '-f' flag and prints out the transliterated characters to the terminal.
- To Dos:
  - Complete the transliterations for vowels and combined consonants
  - Figure out how to combine all cross-combinations of vowels and vowel symbols (see [http://www.omniglot.com/writing/telugu.htm] for reference)
