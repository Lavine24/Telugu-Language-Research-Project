## Overview
The files in this directory contain the data collected from Twitter to check whether or not Telugu had a significant presence on the social network. After running through all of the tweets, it was discovered that only 16/100 of the tweets collected contained Telugu (either the script or romanized form). This might be due to three possible reasons (copied and pasted from CoreRequirements.md).

> After using the tweepy twitter scraper to look for tweets in Telugu, we found a surprisingly small number of tweets in Telugu from the provinces where Telugu is most commonly spoken. This can be attributed to the fact that the twitter data was collected at ~4:30pm EST which is the middle of the night for the east cost of India. Another reason might be the fact that twitter is a fairly english-centric social network. A majority of the content created and shared on the site is written in english and it should be assumed that most users, regardless of their country of origin, would use english as their preferred language of communication.
