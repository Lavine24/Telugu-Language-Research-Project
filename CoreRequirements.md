## Introduction
Telugu is a language with roots in several southeastern provinces in India. Though it is commonly written using a roman alphabet (with the assistance of pronunciation symbols) its original script is roughly 900 years old and is decended from the phoenician and aramaic alphabets.

## Machine Translation Systems

There are a minimal number of machine translation systems for Telugu. The largest is Google, which has incorporated Telugu into their translation site and also has a beta transliteration program. For example, the sentence "this is a sentence" gets translated as దీనిని వాక్యం ఉందిand transliterated as Dīnini vākyaṁ .

There exists a few machine translation papers on Telugu. The first one is a masters thesis on rules for translation/literation, the second has to do with sentence token segmentation, and the third invovles part of speech tagging.
